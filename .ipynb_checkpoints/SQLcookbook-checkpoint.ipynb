    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SQL Zoo**: tutorials and examples for practising SQL coding into webbrowser - <http://sqlzoo.net/>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sams learn SQL in 24 hours**: <http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780672335419/samplepages/0672335417.pdf>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SQL Authority**: puzzles and dbs for specific SQL scenarios - <https://blog.sqlauthority.com/category/sql-puzzle/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### General notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HAVING vs. WHERE:** A HAVING clause in SQL specifies that an SQL SELECT statement should only return rows where aggregate values meet the specified conditions. It was added to the SQL language because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions. WHERE is used before data aggregated and HAVING after. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Always better to push most processing (data query, analysis) down to the database level, to optimize performance, and not do it on the client API.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Subqueries:** In subqueries, queries in brackets always executed first, so should be coded first. Subquery selects can only retrieve a single column.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatic indentation for SQL code (www. poorSQL.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CROSS JOINS*: allows you to take each record from one table and match it with all rows of another. Doesn’t do any matches, just multiplies out all entires.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **INNER JOIN**: matches on some variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Joins are computationally taxing so if you can do something without joins – don’t join.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use qualifiers to abbreviate column names e.g. SELECT o.OrderID # can now refer to just o for OrderID column. Aliases also abbreviate tables/columns, but can also allocate output to new name.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ** SELF JOIN**: join entries up with other entries from same table e.g. grouped on a secondary variable. Match here could mean to have output were all customers in one city are paired with all customers in same city. Self join requires table aliases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LEFT/RIGHT JOIN**: take all entries from Left/Right table and return corresponding entries on Right/Left table, regardless of whether they have complete data on the Left/Right table. Full Outer join returns entries where data is in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **UNION**: stacks outputs of select queries of tables with same number cols in same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Slowly do” principal of SQL coding. Think first! Draw out!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Timestrings are the objects of analysis outputted from Date-Time query functions. Modifiers of Timestrings run from left-to-right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **STRFTIME**: used to extract certain parts of a date-time string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DATE('now')**: output current time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CASE**: mimics if/then in other languages, not to be confused with switch in MATLAB which also takes case arguments. Can also be used as a search statement e.g. for ranges and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **VIEW**: creates temporary tables that are not written to db. Helpful for evaluating query statements. Removed after db connection has ended. To see views use SELECT * and to remove views DROP VIEW my_view.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unspoken needs**: business concerns that are not detailed in original question e.g. \"we want to know what products customers are buying?\", but which customers etc. Answering such questions requires walking between business understanding and data understanding.\n"
